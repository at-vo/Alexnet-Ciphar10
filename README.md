# Alexnet-Ciphar10
Use the Alexnet pretrained model to classify the images in the ciphar-10 dataset. 
A confusion matrix was created that relates the CIFAR10 classes with the 10 most frequent classes from ImageNet predicted by the model.
Trained a linear classifier on the output of the fc6 and fc7 layer features.
